# Message-classifier-project

<br>
This project was conducted as part of udacity's Data scientist nanodegree. The aim of this project is to create an ETL and a ML model and incorporate the model into a web app. The ETL reads data from two csv files, messages.csv and categories.csv
<br><br>
This project consists of three parts :
<br>
1- ETL : Obtains data from CSV files, cleans the data and stores it in a SQLite database
<br>
2- Machine learning pipeline : Takes the data from the ETL, tokenizes the text and outputs a model that classifies text messages into one or more of 36 categories. This file outputs a classifier in a pkl file
<br>
3- Web app : a web app that uses the model to predict the categories of text messages and shows charts on available data

## Running the project files
1- process_data.py :
<br>This file will read data from the two CSV files (messages.csv and categories.csv), clean the data, combine and save it into a SQLite database named project2.db
<br><br>
Make sure both csv files are in the same directory as the python ETL file
<br><br>
Navigate to the "data" folder and run the following command 
<br><br>
```
python process_data.py
```
<br>
2- train_classifier.py :
<br>This file reads the clean data generated from step 1 and saved into the SQLite database to create classifier trained on text messages.  This file will output a classifier in a pickle file named message_classifier.pkl
<br><br>
Please note that the pkl could not be uploaded to this repository because the file size was too large (larger than 100 MB)
<br><br>
Navigate to the "models" folder and run the following command 
<br><br>

```
python train_classifier.py
```
<br>
3- run.py :
<br>
This file reads the clean data generated from step 1 and saved into the SQLite database as well as the saved model message_classifier.pkl
<br><br>
Navigate to the "app" folder and run the following command 
<br><br>

```
python run.py
```
<br><br>
